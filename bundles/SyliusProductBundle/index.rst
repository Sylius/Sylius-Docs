SyliusProductBundle
===================

Sylius product catalog is made available as set of 2 standalone bundles. This component contains the most basic product model with properties (attributes) support.
It also includes the product prototyping system, which serves as a template for creating similar products.

If you need product options support, please see :doc:`SyliusVariableProductBundle </bundles/SyliusVariableProductBundle/index>` which allows to manage
product variations with a very flexible architecture.
