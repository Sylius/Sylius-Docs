SyliusProductBundle
===================

The Sylius product catalog is available as a set of 2 standalone bundles. This component contains the most basic product model with properties (attributes) support.
It also includes product prototyping system, which serves as template for creating similar products.

If you need product options support, please see :doc:`SyliusVariableProductBundle </bundles/SyliusVariableProductBundle/index>` which allows to manage
product variations with very flexible architecture.
