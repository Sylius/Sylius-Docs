SyliusAddressingBundle
======================

Addressing system for Symfony2 applications.

With minimal configuration you can introduce addresses, countries, provinces and zones management into your project.

It's fully customizable, but the default setup should be optimal for most use cases.

There are several models inside the bundle, `Address`, `Country`, `Province`, `Zone` and `ZoneMember`.

There is also a **ZoneMatcher** service.
You'll get familiar with it in further parts of this documentation.
