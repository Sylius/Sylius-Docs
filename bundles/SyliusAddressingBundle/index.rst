SyliusAddressingBundle
======================

Addressing system for Symfony2 applications.

With minimal configuration you can introduce addresses, countries, provinces and zones management into your project.
It's fully customizable, but the default setup should be optimal for most use cases.

It also contains zone matching mechanisms, which allow you to match customer addresses to appriopriate tax/shipping (or any other) zones.
