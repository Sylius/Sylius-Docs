Using the Controllers
=====================

When using the bundle, you have access to a controller for each model.
You can use them to manipulate and manage your product catalog.

Controller services
-------------------

All controllers in bundle are powered by :doc:`SyliusResourceBundle </bundles/SyliusResourceBundle/index>`. Please read the documentation to have a complete understanding what you can do.

.. note::

    To be written.

Learn how to override default controllers by reading :doc:`this chapter </bundles/SyliusProductBundle/overriding_controllers>`.
