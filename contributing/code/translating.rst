Translating Sylius
==================

The translation process is handled with Crowdin. Please, create a `free account <https://crowdin.net/join>`_ and join the `Sylius project <http://translate.sylius.org>`_. Then choose your language and a bundle you want to work on. Here we are, you can start to translate :)

Synchronization between Crowdin and Github is done manually at the moment. If you need the latest translations, please ping us on this `Gihub ticket <https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/issues/1080>`_. We'll do our best to update the translations quickly.
